 Analyzes complex interaction patterns  
 Provides comprehensive discrimination evidence  

Regulatory Compliance  
MLN Rule Implementation  
 Example: Vectorenhanced fair lending rule  
'AI_VECTOR: FOR ALL x, y: VectorSimilar(FinancialProfile(x), FinancialProfile(y), 0.95)  
AND White(x) AND Black(y) AND SameLender(x, y) AND Approved(x) AND NOT Approved(y)  
IMPLIES DiscriminatoryPattern(Lender(y))'  

Risk Tier Classification  
 AI_TIER_1_CRITICAL: Immediate regulatory examination required

 AI_TIER_3_ELEVATED_RISK: Enhanced monitoring with embedding analysis  
 AI_TIER_4_MONITORING: Standard supervision with AI alerts  
 AI_TIER_5_LOW_RISK: Routine oversight  

Confidence Scoring  
 VERY_HIGH_CONFIDENCE: Strong AI + statistical evidence  
 HIGH_CONFIDENCE: AI evidence + significance testing  
 MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE: AI patterns detected  
 LOW_CONFIDENCE: Weak AI signals  
 INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE: No discrimination detected
